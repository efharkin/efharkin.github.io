      - Worked with a team of 10 engineers, software developers, scientific
        liasons, and marketers to create a smart knee brace in a weekend,
        winning a place at inter-city finals in Waterloo
      - Contributed data science
        - Extracted relevant features of knee-joint health (eg range of motion)
          from accelerometer and gyroscope data
        - Worked together with machine learning engineer to predict simulated
          knee injury vs. healthy control based on gait using LSTM deep neural
          network implemented with [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org)
          Keras
        - Implemented data cleaning, preparation, and feature engineering
          components of machine learning pipeline in Python
