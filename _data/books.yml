  - title: The Elements of Statistical Learning
    authors: Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman
    description: |
      - A comprehensive text on bread-and-butter statistical methods used in
        data science
      - Emphasizes the mathematical rationale behind methods for predictive
        modeling, dimensionality reduction, and function approximation
      - Great as an introduction and as a reference: I got my copy in 2016 and
        still pick it up off my bookshelf

  - title: Reinforcement Learning
    authors: Sutton and Barto
    description: |
      - An introduction to models that learn to make predictions by interacting
        with their environments
      - Written for engineers, but still interesting for neuroscientists and
        psychologists
          - I distilled some of the key concepts for systems neuroscientists in
            a seminar series in 2019; you can view the slides
            [here](/assets/doc/Harkin_Emerson_2019_reinforcement_learning.pdf)

  - title: Deep Learning
    authors: Goodfellow, Bengio, and Courville
    description: |
      - A survey of popular black-box methods for function approximation and
        the heuristics behind them
      - Buy this book if you want a lightly mathematical survey of common
        neural network architectures and training algorithms
      - Buy a different book if you want to get a machine learning pipeline off
        the ground as fast as possible

coding:
  - title: Clean Code
    authors: Robert C. Martin
    description: |
      - Could have been titled "How to Write Code that Other People Can
        Understand"
          - This is a **severely** undervalued skill in science, especially
            condering that "other people" is a category that will come to
            include you in three weeks time
      - Written in a slightly argumentative style and full of admonishments
        that will raise eyebrows (my favourite being that the ideal function is
        one line long and takes no arguments), but concrete, persuasive, and
        well worth a read

  - title: Effective C++
    authors: Scott Meyers
    description: |
      - Useful to read for its concrete treatment of object oriented
        programming even if you don't write C++
      - As a person who lives mainly in Python, this gave me a more thorough
        appreciation for all the low-level high-performance headaches I don't
        have to deal with on a daily basis

  - title: The R Inferno
    authors: Patrick Burns
    description: |
      - The first and probably funniest book I've read about programming
      - From the abstract: "If you are using R and you think you're in hell,
        this is a map for you."
          - Written for scientists and statisticians struggling with
            programming, not programmers struggling with statistics
      - You might need to read this book if you don't know why `1.1 + 2.2 !=
        3.3`
          - It's [free](https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf)
            from the author

neuro:
  - title: Neuronal Dynamics
    authors: >
      Gerstner, Kistler,
      <a href="https://med.uottawa.ca/cellular-molecular/people/naud-richard">Naud</a>,
      and Paninski
    description: |
      - An introduction to mathematical models of biological neurons written
        mainly for physicists and engineers
      - Emphasis on GLM-based models of single neurons
